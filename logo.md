To create a logo for **Supreme Auto Body of New York**, you want to balance the grit and professionalism of a New York body shop with the vibrant, proud heritage of Jamaica.

Since I am an AI text model, I cannot "draw" the file for you, but I can provide **four distinct design concepts** and the **exact prompts** you can use in an AI image generator (like Midjourney or DALL-E) to create them.

### Concept 1: The "Island Shield" (Heritage & Protection)
This design uses a classic automotive shield to represent protection and quality. It subtly incorporates the Jamaican flag colors within a high-end metallic framework.

*   **Visuals:** A chrome or brushed-metal shield. Inside the shield is a sleek silhouette of a modern sports car.
*   **Color Palette:** Racing Green, Gold, and Black (the Jamaican colors) used as trim or "go-faster" stripes on the car.
*   **Typography:** "SUPREME" in a bold, heavy sans-serif font (like Impact or Montserrat) across the top. "Auto Body of New York" in a smaller, clean font at the bottom.
*   **Vibe:** Professional, established, and proud.

### Concept 2: The "NYC Skyline & Spray" (Industrial & Urban)
This highlights the New York location while using color to nod to the owner’s roots.

*   **Visuals:** A silhouette of the Manhattan skyline. The base of the buildings transforms into the shape of a car’s hood. A professional paint spray gun is "spraying" a trail of gold and green mist that forms the name of the shop.
*   **Color Palette:** Charcoal Grey (for the city), with vibrant Green and Yellow accents in the "paint spray."
*   **Typography:** Gritty, stencil-style font or a modern "blocky" font that looks like it belongs on a New York storefront.
*   **Vibe:** Modern, "hustle," and artistic.

### Concept 3: The "Minimalist Speed Line" (Luxury & Performance)
This is for a shop that handles high-end or custom work. It’s very clean and expensive-looking.

*   **Visuals:** A stylized "S" that looks like a winding road or the curve of a car fender. A thin tri-color line (Green, Yellow, Black) underlines the word "Supreme."
*   **Color Palette:** Black background with Silver metallic text. The Jamaican colors are used only as a tiny "accent" flag or pinstripe.
*   **Typography:** Luxury serif or ultra-modern thin font (like Eurostile).
*   **Vibe:** High-end, "Supreme" quality, elite.

### Concept 4: The "Vintage Garage Badge" (Trust & Community)
A circular "seal" logo that looks great on hats, t-shirts, and shop signs.

*   **Visuals:** A circular gear or tire border. In the center, a classic 1970s New York muscle car. Two palm leaves (symbolizing Jamaica) cross like swords behind the car.
*   **Color Palette:** Deep Black, Sun-Yellow, and Emerald Green.
*   **Typography:** The text wraps around the circle: "SUPREME AUTO BODY" on top, "NEW YORK" on the bottom.
*   **Vibe:** Old-school craftsmanship, friendly, "neighborhood staple."
